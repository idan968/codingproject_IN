The project will be an optimization and collection of previous scripts use to extract data from large H5 files generated at a synchrotron.
The script should be able to convert each intensity and 2theta columns from integrated data in H5 file format to .xy files and also extract the timestamps related to each data set within the H5 file. These should finally be converted from unix time to seconds.
If time allows, the script will also include a plot of the heatmap generated by the now generated .xy files as a function of 2theta and the time.
